I am an undergraduate student in [Industrial Engineering at Seoul National University](https://ie.snu.ac.kr/en/){:target="_blank"} with research interests in Operations Research, Reinforcement Learning, and Graph Machine Learning.

My work focuses on optimization under uncertainty, large-scale decision-making systems, and learning-based approaches to complex networked environments. I am particularly interested in bridging theoretical foundations with practical applications in supply chain systems, data-driven optimization, and AI-assisted decision support.

Currently, I am developing research-oriented projects that integrate optimization modeling, stochastic systems, and machine learning methodologies.
