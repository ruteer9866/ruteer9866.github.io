<p>
I am an undergraduate student in <a href="https://ie.snu.ac.kr/en/" target="_blank">
  Industrial Engineering at Seoul National University
</a>
with research interests in Operations Research, Reinforcement Learning, and Graph Machine Learning.<br>

My work focuses on optimization under uncertainty, large-scale decision-making systems, and learning-based approaches to complex networked environments. I am particularly interested in bridging theoretical foundations with practical applications in supply chain systems, data-driven optimization, and AI-assisted decision support.<br>

Currently, I am developing research-oriented projects that integrate optimization modeling, stochastic systems, and machine learning methodologies.<br>
