I am an undergraduate student in Industrial Engineering at Seoul National University, with research interests in Operations Research, Reinforcement Learning, and Graph Machine Learning.<br>

My work focuses on optimization under uncertainty, large-scale decision-making systems, and learning-based approaches to complex networked environments. I am particularly interested in bridging theoretical foundations with practical applications in supply chain systems, data-driven optimization, and AI-assisted decision support.<br>

Currently, I am developing research-oriented projects that integrate optimization modeling, stochastic systems, and machine learning methodologies.<br>
